Release history for JooseX.Namespace.Depended

0.16      2011-01-23 12:40

    - minor performance improvement - avoid extra `prepareProperties` call, instead call directly to SUPER method
    
    - fixed bug, when the loaded scripts could not use require (`runInThisContext` runs the scripts in clear scope, which
      doesn't have usual node globals, like `require`)

0.15      2011-01-12 21:40

    - "eval" materializer now evalutes the code in the global scope (indirect eval or `execScript` in IE)
    - more robust detection whether we run in Test.Run scope or in normal interpreter (allows to have file names in stack traces)

0.14      2010-12-14 20:48

    - bumped deps
    - tests for lazy classes upgraded to recent changes in JooseX.Meta.Lazy
    - throw Error instances and not strings in several places

0.13      2010-12-09 21:10

    - fixed bug, when the current module was not being taken into account during deps loading 
    (affected classes wrapped with Modules) 

    - default Materialization role switched back to Eval, since its been finally turned out, that Firebug
    *can* debug the code, executed with "eval". In the same time, Firebug *can't* (at least AFAIK) debug
    the code, executed with assignment to `text` property of <script> tag 

0.12      2010-11-18 22:09

    - various docs updates
    
    - uncommented tests for dependencies in "Lazy" classes on NodeJS platform
    
    - JooseX.Meta.Lazy excluded from the `Auto` bundle (was only required for testing) 
    - JooseX.SimpleRequest included into the `Web` bundle
    
    - removed XHRSync transport, as it turned out that truly synchronous mode won't support files concatenation 
    
    - `use.paths` is now the preferred way to specify the INC paths instead of `JooseX.Namespace.Depended.Manager.my.INC`
       using `JooseX.Namespace.Depended.Manager.my.INC` is still supported but will be removed in some of the future releases
       
    - improved <script> transport (still hardly usable on IE because of lacking 'onerror' support)
    - switched to 'ScriptTag' as a default materialization for Web
    
    - added 'async' attribute for <script> transport
      w/o this attribute the <script>s used for transporting could interfere with <script>s used for materialization which 
      caused test failures in FF
      
    - now can handle dependencies from the 'has' section of class declaration:
    
        Class('SomeClass', {
        
            has : {
                attr : {
                    meta    : 'Attribute.Meta',
                    trait   : 'Attribute.Trait'
                }
            }
        })

    - really fixed NodeJS materialization

0.06      2010-08-31 15:16

    - implemented "Delayed dependencies" feature
    
    - refactored out 'inturl/exturl' resources
    - refactored out "Locator.URL" role
    
    - "nonjoose" resource refactored into more general "javascript" resource
    - "javascript" resource is automatically created, if token contain '/' or ends with '.js' 
    
    - added 'presence' attribute to base resource (can be specified in token)
    
    - improved version check (don't remove the VERSION from class definition)
    - improved test coverage for loading "static" files
    
    - fixed NodeJS materialization role

0.05      2010-07-05 19:21

    - switched to Dist::Zilla
    
    - added `skip` sections to test suite to allow cross-platform testing
    
    - test suite now passes on the NodeJS platform

0.04    

    [ENHANCEMENTS]
    
        - greatly improved synchronous-ness of the dependencies loading, if the files are bundled in proper order 
    
    [API CHANGES]

    -none-

    [BUG FIXES]
    
        - fixed bug, when already loaded non-joose classes could been handled asynchronously (instead of synchronously) 

0.03    

    [ENHANCEMENTS]
    
        - implemented 'require' resource which is just a basic wrapper around the CommonJS module
    
    [API CHANGES]

    -none-

    [BUG FIXES]
    
    -none-




0.02    

    [ENHANCEMENTS]
    
    - added non-blocking NodeJS transport and materialization roles
    
    - added NodeJS package: Task.JooseX.Namespace.Depended.NodeJS
      
    - If some class don't have the dependencies, than it becomes "ready" synchronously.
      Thus, if we have a concatenated file with the inter-dependended classes, which are
      sorted in the dependency order, it will be executed synchronously
    
    [API CHANGES]

    `materialize` method of Resource now also receives the url of the loaded resource as 2nd argument
    

    [BUG FIXES]
    
    -none-
